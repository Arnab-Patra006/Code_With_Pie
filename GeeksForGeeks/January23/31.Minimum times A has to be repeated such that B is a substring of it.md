# <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/fda70097eb2895ecfff269849b6a8aace441947c/1">Minimum times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it</a>

### Approach 1 : C++ | Brute Force :

There can be three possible cases :
- step 1:
1. a.size() < b.size() :
- if this is the case , first we have to make the size of a >= b.
Bcz, b can't be a substring of a if it's size is greater than a.
for that we simply append a until size of a is less than b. After,that automatically we can have only two possible cases : 2 & 3.  
2. a.size() = b.size() 
3. a.size() > b.size() 

- step 2:
Now we check wheather b is substring of a by c++ stl .find().
if its true then we simply return count as ans.

Else we append a to itself and check again as per step 2. If we still not getting true then b can't be a substring of a hence return -1.

class Solution {
  public:
    int minRepeats(string A, string B) {
        // code here
        int count=1;
        string temp=A;
        while(A.size()<B.size())
        {
            A=A+temp;
            count++;
        }
        if(A.find(B)!=-1)
        {
            return count;
        }
        A=A+temp;
        count++;
        if(A.find(B)!=-1)
        {
            return count;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
