## Approach 1 : C++ | DP | O(N)

## Explaination :
<!-- ## 1. We will traverse from n-1 th index to 0 th index & check wheather the arr[index] along with index will lead to cycle or not.It will take O(N) time. -->

##  How To Determine Cycle or BAD index? There are two possibilities :
###  i. If arr[index]=0 then it is a cycle.
###  ii. If index is not visited we do visited[index]=1 then,
- after doing (index+arr[index]=>so on )it comes back to itself & find itself visited or such a index that already a bad index then it will consider itself as bad & return back to all such idx from where was called and make them as bad index.

## How to know if an index is GOOD ? There are also two possibilities :
###  i. Eiter it's index+arr[index]>n-1 leads to out of array index i.e <0 or >n-1.
###  ii. Or it reaches to such index that is a good one.

## Time Complexity : O(N)

+ At the worst condition it may happen that, there is an index for which we recursively called all n elements. Now ultimately we will get an ans for that. As we have traversed all n elements now we know their validity[(good)true/(bad)false].
+ So now for rest of the iteration we will simply be able to check validity in O(1).  
### Therefore ultimately it will be : O(N).
### Example 1:

```
Input: [2, 3, -1, 2, -2, 4, 1]
Output: 3
Explanation: Index 3, 5 and 6 are safe only. As index 1, 4, 2 forms a cycle and from index 0 you can go to index 2 which is part of cycle.
```
### Example 2:
<img src="img/16_1.png" width="600px">

```
Input: [1, 0, -3, 0, -5, 0]
Output: 2
Explanation: Index 2 and 4 are safe only. As index 0, 1, 3, 5 form cycle.
