# C++ and STL
# Topics Need To be covered : CF Rating basis (<900 to 1600)
## 1. Number Theory :

. Basic knowledge of Primes,Multiples,Divisors
. Bitwise Operations
. Euclidean Algorithm
. Sieve of Eratosthenes
. Binary Modular Exponentiation
. Combinatorics
Resources :

. Utkarsh Gupta's number theory video.


## 2. Binary Search and Ternary Search(Not imp for <1600):
. General binary search.
. Monotonic Functions(understand and proving)
. C++ STL functions
. Binary searching on answer
. Convex functions
. Ternary Search(basics)
Resources :
. Codeforces Edu section
. Binary search video on TLE Eleminators
. CP algorithms-Ternary search

# 3. Greedy 
. Standard Greedy Problems
. Learning to prove my solution(optional: Exchange arguments)
. Problems from searching and sorting sections of CSES(First 50%)
Resources:
- Geeks for Geeks Standard Greedy Problems
- Exchange Arguments Algorithms Live Video
- CSES Problemset (Try first 50% problems from Searching and Sorting Section)

# 4. Dynamic Programming 
. Standard DP problems.
. Problems from DP section of CSES problemset
. Basics of DP with Bitmasking
. Basics of DP on Trees
. No need for iterative DP at this point.
Resources :
- Errichto’s DP Beginner Videos
- CSES Problemset (Try first 60% problems from DP Section)
- Kartik Arora’s DP Playlist
- AtCoder DP Contest (Try first 10 problems)
- Utkarsh Gupta’s AtCoder Solutions (Hindi)
- After doing all try out random 1700-1800 problems on CF

# 5. Trees :(>=1400)
. Basic Properties
. DFS
. Binary Lifting
. Finding LCA in LogN
. Trees section of CSES Problemset
Resources:
- Tree Video 1, Tree Video 2 on Priyansh Agarwal Channel
- Galen Collins Trees Topic Stream
- Errichto Binary Lifting Video
- CSES Problemset (Try first 6% problems from Trees Section)
Once all done then do DP on trees.

# 6. Graphs :
. Basic properties
. DFS,BFS
. Connected Components
. Directed Graph Basics
. 1 Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm (Prims or Kruskal)
. Optional: DSU 
Resources :
- Galen Collins Graphs Topic Stream
- William Fiset Graph Theory Playlist
- CSES Problemset (Try first 10-12 problems from Graphs Section)
- Then do Random cf till 1700rating.

# 7. Topics to NOT do: (It means this topics are advance 
and maybe time waste for now bcz previous topics were much more essential)
. Advanced Number Theory :Euler Totient Function, etc
. Chinese Remainder Theorem
. Range Query DS Like Segment Trees,Fenwick Trees.(needed when D,E level on CF)
. Square Root Decomposition
. Centroid Decomposition
. Heavy Light Decomposition
. DP Optimizations
. Euler Tour
. Strongly connected components
. Matrix Exponentiation.
. Binary or General Tries
. Advance String algorithms (KMP,Z,Manacher's)
