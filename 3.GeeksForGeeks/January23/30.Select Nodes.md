### Approach 1 : Simple DFS | C++
1. make an adjacency list from edges pair.
2. now keep one visited array & counter globally one to keep track which node is visited or not & count to calculate ans.
3. now make a dfs function & pass the adjacency list & starting node(here considered 1 as starting node).
4. Main concept -> 
- if the node is a leaf node then it can't be lighten so it will return false.
- if the parent node gets response from it's child node as false then the parent has to be enlightn & it becomes true.
when we are getting a lighten node we do count=count+1.
- else if the parent node gets response from it's child node as true then it can't be lighten so it will return false to it's parent. 

5. Finally return the count as answer.

```
class Solution{
  public:
  vector<int>visited;
  int count;
  bool dfs(vector<int>adj[],int root)
  {
      visited[root]=1;
      bool selected=false;
      for(auto child:adj[root])
      {
          if(visited[child]==0)
          {
              bool res=dfs(adj,child);
              if(res==false)
              {
                  selected=true;
              }
          }
      }
      if(selected==true)
      {
          count++;
      }
      return selected;
  }
    int countVertex(int N, vector<vector<int>>edges){
        // code here
        vector<int>adj[N+1];
        for(int i=0;i<edges.size();i++)
        {
            adj[edges[i][0]].push_back(edges[i][1]);
            adj[edges[i][1]].push_back(edges[i][0]);
        }
        visited=vector<int>(N+1,0);
        count=0;
        dfs(adj,1);
        return count;
    }
};
```
