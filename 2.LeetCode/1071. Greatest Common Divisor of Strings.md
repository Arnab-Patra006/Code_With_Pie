# <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/greatest-common-divisor-of-strings/">1071. Greatest Common Divisor of Strings</a>

- Intuition
The line "t divides s" if and only if s = t + ... + t.
We first need to check if GCD is even possible among the two strings.
Two strings str1 and str2 will have gcd if and only if 
```
$$str1+str2 == str2+str1$$.
```
For example:
```
str1 = "ABABAB"
str2 = "ABAB"

str1+str2 = "ABABABABAB"
str2+str1 = "ABABABABAB"
```
If both the strings are made of same substring concatenated multiple times then they will have GCD.

- How to find the length?
An important question appeared in my mind when I was solving this. How will I find the length of the answer or the GCD string! I looked closer into the examples. You can see for example 1 :
str1.length() = 6 and str2.length() = 3. But the answer length is $$3$$.
What is the GCD of $$6$$ and $$3$$? Answer is $$3$$.

How about example 2?
str1.length() = 6 and str2.length() = 4. But the answer length is $$2$$.
What is the GCD of $$6$$ and $$4$$? Answer is $$2$$.

So, our answer will be substring of length $$2$$ from any of the strings str1 or str2.
## That is the gcd of the lengths of two strings.Hence -

```
class Solution {
public:
    string gcdOfStrings(string str1, string str2) {
        if(str1+str2!=str2+str1)
        {
            return "";
        }
        int g=gcd(str1.size(),str2.size());
        return str1.substr(0,g);
    }
};
```
